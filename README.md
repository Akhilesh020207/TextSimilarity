# AN APPROACH FOR MEASURING UNSTRUCTURED TEXT DOCUMENT SIMILARITY USING LDA-BERT EMBEDDING MODEL
1. This project is used to measure text similarity between pairs of PDF documents using a combination of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Bidirectional Encoder 
Representations from Transformers (BERT) embedding models.
2. The proposed approach involves using LDA to extract topic distributions from the documents first, followed by BERT to generate contextualized embeddings of the topics. 
3. The resulting embeddings are then used to calculate the similarity scores between the pairs of documents .
4. The experiment was conducted on a dataset comprising of various categories of PDF documents, including scientific research papers, legal documents, and news articles.
5. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms traditional methods such as Cosine similarity and Jaccard similarity in terms accuracy and robustness.
6. Overall, this research demonstrates the potential of the  LDA-BERT embedding model in improving the accuracy and efficiency of text similarity measurements,  which has significant applications in various fields, including document analysis, plagiarism detection, and  information retrieval.
